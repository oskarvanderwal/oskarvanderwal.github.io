<h1>About me</h1>
<div class="entry-content"> <p>I am currently a PhD candidate at <a href="https://www.illc.uva.nl/">ILLC</a>, at the University of Amsterdam, advised by <a href="https://www.uva.nl/profiel/s/c/k.schulz/k.schulz.html">Katrin Schulz</a> and <a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/w.zuidema/">Willem Zuidema</a>.
My research focuses on understanding why and how language models exhibit social biases, and how these insights can be used for investigating the hidden biases in digital media.I study how we can reliably measure bias in NLP and try to ground the discussion of bias in the broader societal perspective.
As part of <a href="https://bias-barometer.github.io/">the Bias Barometer research group</a>, I also work on developing NLP techniques to investigate the (hidden) biases in Dutch digital media, in a broader multidisciplinary effort to understand its role on the public perception of politics, events, and social groups.</p>
<p>Previously I was a Master's student Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam, where I did my thesis on the topic of <em>language emergence in referential games</em>.
As an undergraduate, I studied at the University College Twente -- a selective Bachelor’s program focusing on both technology and its role in society.</p> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->
